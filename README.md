# Header for this readme

This is an attempt at making Quarto. Things to do to improve it:

1. Split the code into different files so that it's far more readable
2. Comment up the code to make it far more readable
3. Modify the game board with Tkinter to make it more presentable
4. Improve the minimax opponent so that it actually works
5. Try to add other computer opponents (random, q_learn, MCTS, etc)

## This section shows I used a new branch

Why won't it track these??? Ok I need to save it
